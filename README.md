# Changelog

This repository contains the changelog for React Native.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/). Emojii use is based on [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me/) recommendations.

## Style Rules

- Class names for internal things that aren't in docs are put in *italics*
- Methods, props, style names, and examples are put in `monotype`
- Component names are put in **bold**
